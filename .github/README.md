# Contributing Notes

Thanks for checking this out. This repository is a **portfolio preview** and intentionally incomplete. Issues and PRs are welcome, but the bar for changes is clarity and presentation rather than full feature coverage.

If you submit a change, please keep scope small and document behavior changes in the PR description.
